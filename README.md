# Bleuatre-Plasma-theme-and-color-scheme
Bleuâtre is a bluish/purplish color-scheme with 3 variants from lighter to darker starting at Bleuâtre and going to Bleuâtre-2 and so on. 
There is also a transparent plasma theme to match and it will work for all three color schemes so 1 plasma theme and 3 color schemes.

Icons in the screenshots are the Laferte-Blue icons and I will leave them here also and I will also post them to the kde store but i havent yet so i will leave address when I do. 

Wallapers in screenshots are from Charlie Henson here:
