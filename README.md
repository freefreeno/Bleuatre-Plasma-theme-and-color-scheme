# Bleuatre-Plasma-theme-and-color-scheme
Bleuâtre is a bluish/purplish color-scheme with 3 variants from lighter to darker starting at Bleuâtre and going to Bleuâtre-2 and so on. 
There is also a transparent plasma theme to match and it will work for all three color schemes so 1 plasma theme and 3 color schemes.

Icons in the screenshots are the Laferte-Blue icons and I will leave them here also and I will also post them to the kde store but i havent yet so I will leave address when I do. The original laferte icons would not work in KDE Plasma so I made them work and changed colors.
I have more colors made but I havent found the time to get everything made yet so bar with me.
Original laferte icons are here:
